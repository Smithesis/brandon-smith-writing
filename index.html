            <p>Welcome to my website. This website focuses on my writing projects that I have completed and would like
                to
                share with the world. I am new to the idea of writing, especially sharing my work with other people.
                This
                page and my projects are vey much in their infancy. I have created this page myself as I am teaching
                myself
                web development as well. Hopefully as my development skills and my writing skills both improve, this
                page
                will continue to improve as well.</p>
